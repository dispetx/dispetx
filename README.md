# Javnik

Suppose we have the following definition:

**Definition** (Public Domain Internet Host). *The public domain internet host
is a host such that the following holds:*

```bash
$ ssh root@IPaddress
Password: root
```bash

Such a host is called a javnik. Javnik is a non-existent croatian word which
is derived as an opposite to the word "tajnik" (eng. secretary). Both words
are derived from the noun "tajna" (eng. secret).

Origin and definition of the word java

The word "Java" has multiple origins and meanings, depending on its context. Here are the key points:
1. Java (Island and Language Origin)

    Origin: The word "Java" originally refers to the island of Java in Indonesia, which has been known by that name for centuries. The name "Java" may have originated from the Sanskrit word "yava" (which means "barley" or "grain"), possibly because the island was famous for its agricultural richness.
    Definition: In this context, Java refers to the most populous island in Indonesia, a historically significant and culturally rich area. It has been a central location for ancient kingdoms, colonial occupation, and modern political and economic development.

2. Java (Programming Language)

    Origin: The Java programming language was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Initially, the project was called "Oak" (after a tree outside Gosling's office), but due to trademark issues, it was renamed "Java." The team chose "Java" as a name after Java coffee, which was known for its energizing qualities. This was a nod to the dynamic and powerful nature of the new programming language.
    Definition: In this context, Java refers to a widely-used object-oriented programming language known for its portability, security, and scalability. It is often used for building web applications, mobile apps (particularly on Android), and enterprise software.

3. Java (Slang for Coffee)

    Origin: The term "java" also became a popular slang for coffee in the United States, stemming from the association with the island of Java, which was a major exporter of coffee beans.
    Definition: Here, "Java" simply means coffee, and it is often used in casual conversation to refer to a cup of coffee.

In summary, Java has different meanings, but its origins trace back to the Indonesian island, from which the name has spread to both the tech world and everyday language (through coffee).

In croatian?

In Croatian, the word "Java" can have different meanings depending on the context, much like in English. Here are the relevant meanings:
1. Java (Croatian Language Context):

    Definition: In Croatian, the word "java" refers to wakefulness or reality (as opposed to dreaming). It is used to describe the state of being awake and conscious. This meaning is related to the term for real life or something experienced outside of dreams.
    Example: "Ovo nije san, ovo je java." ("This is not a dream, this is reality.")

2. Java (Island and Language Context):

    Definition: Similar to in English, "Java" also refers to the island of Java in Indonesia in Croatian, with the same historical and geographical significance.

3. Java (Programming Language):

    Definition: In the tech context, "Java" in Croatian refers to the Java programming language just as it does in English, used for software development. The term is untranslated in this context.

4. Java (Coffee Context):

    Definition: In Croatian, the word "java" does not refer to coffee as it does in English. However, "kava" is the Croatian word for coffee, which sounds somewhat similar.

So in Croatian:

    "Java" means reality or wakefulness.
    "Java" can also refer to the island of Java or the Java programming language, depending on the context.
