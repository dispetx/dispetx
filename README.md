# Javnik

**Abstract**

This is the development of a rigorous mathematical theory dealing with public
relations or public information. We develop the theory in conjuction with the
specification and implementation of the public domain internet, which we
define informally as a set of hosts which preserve the root privilege. In other
words, we assume that every access to the public domain internet is authorized
and that everyone has the same root privilege. We call such a host a public domain
internet host or just a javnik.

**Preface**

If you read how some famous mathematicians such as Gauss communicated with those
of root privilege, you may think that this discussion, although possible in
principle, would cost much. The reason is simple. It is not cheap to question
privileges, but the computer systems in general and Unix-like operating systems
in particular offer a safe environment in which one can do just that efficiently.

The abstract mathematical structure of the root preserving systems provides a
canonical example of a mathematical object that is more important then any other
mathematical structure. It is more important because an interpretation of such
a theory determines your social status, whether you should be killed, rewarded or
anything in between. This is a simple and easy to understand theory.
There is no new sofisticated terminology and one can consider the theory done, 
when one reads the Decleration of independence or any other similar document. Yet
in practice, things are much different and that theory may be just a dead ink on
a paper or completely forgotten after some time. Further privatisation of
computing resources and machine learning technology will just deteriorate the
situation faster. I do not see any benefits of machine learning technology or 
any other tehnology without the context h                                                            


 

## Notation

We use the core of conventional mathematics to construct a rigorous theory.
If the theory conforms to the standard of a rigorous mathematical exposition,
we are the last to say so. Thus, we only consider machine-checked-proofs as
formal arguments and consider all the rest to be informal discussion.

For simplicity, one is free to take all of the statements of a given theory as
axioms. 

## Introduction

We define the public domain internet as the set of javniks, which are in turn
defined to be the containers or sets of public information. The theory does not
say anything about which information is or should be public and for simplicity
we just suppose that every bit of information is java.

**Definition 0.0.0** (Java) *Java is the information that is not secret and 
not private.*

The terms secret and private are primitives, i.e undefined in this theory,
but may have it's uses in the interpretations of the theory.

**Definition 0.0.1** (Javnik). *A javnik is a set of javas.*

**Axiom 0.0.2** *For any object x and any javnik J, if x is an element of
a javnik J, then x is java.* 

In Croatian, the word "java" does not refer to coffee as it does in English.
However, "kava" is the Croatian word for coffee, which sounds somewhat similar.
In Croatian "java" means reality or wakefulness.

**Definition 0** (Public Domain Internet Host). *The public domain internet host
is a host such that the following holds:*

```bash
$ ssh root@IPaddress
Password: root
